##RESEARCH PLAN
####Working Titles: 
MuseumMindMaze; MuseumMania 
####Author and stakeholders: 
Museum educators, IT dept, education dept, public school teachers/partners
####Due Date: February 13, 2017
My background and work in museums has been a way for me to combine my expertise in art history and education with my passion for cultural institutions and creating unique ways to bring communities together around art. Now with multiple VR and AR offerings helping museums become more accessible to diverse audiences, I researched to see if museums I loved had accessible APIs for their collections that could be used for open-source code. I was inspired by an old PC encyclopedia game that helped me to become more interested in learning about the world to create a trivia game for local museums (3 out of 10 researched) based on their collections and changing exhibitions.
####My goal is to help infrequent museum visitors explore, learn, and increase interest in art and museums.
####Research questions:
1. Would people attend a museum more because of this app?
1. Would people use this app while attending the museum?
1. Would people share their experiences online because of this app?
1. Would school groups become more interested in museums/art because of this app?
1. Would people who attend museums infrequently become more interested in museums/art because of this app?
1. Will this app help to increase funding for museums and research?
1. Will this app help make museums and art more accessible for diverse, and traditional underrepresented audiences?

####Methodology: 
1. 20-30 minutes per participant (Max: 5 participants)
1. Give participant background on project (goals, wants, personal experience, etc.)
1. View short retro PC encyclopedia game demo on YouTube
1. Review together 2-3 museum apps and collections
1. Discuss history/relationship with museum attendance and interest
1. Discuss combination of mobile gaming, education, social media, and museum visits

####Participants:

1. Both frequent and infrequent museum-goers
1. Public school teachers who have taken students to museums on school/class trips

####Schedule:
1. Participant recruitment: January 30-31
1. Study: February 1
1. Results: February 3 

####Script: 
1. Topics/Questions: 
    * Favorite Museums?
    * Favorite genre/sub-genre of art?
    * Most recent exhibition visited?
    * Do they play mobile games and why?
    * Do they share their museum experiences on social media?

  -A bio about the app/mission




###**HOW MIGHT WE…?**

1. How might we get both students who go to museums as school trips, and visitors who have never been to the museum excited to go and learn about the objects?
1. How might we get infrequent museum visitors to explore the museum and art without getting bored?
1. How might we help infrequent museum visitors explore, learn, and increase interest in art and museums?

###**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Infrequent museum goers need a way to expand their knowledge and increase their interest in art and museums to help increase institution relevance in communities, art appreciation and reintegration in curriculums, and overall better understanding of the importance of art collection and preservation.

###**HYPOTHESIS**

We believe that by creating a trivia game that utilizes various museum collections’ APIs for infrequent museum goers and student/school groups, we will achieve a deeper engagement with the art, and greater art appreciation, understanding, and reintegration in curriculum.
