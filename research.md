HOW MIGHT WE…?

1) How might we get both students who go to museums as school trips, and visitors who have never been to the museum excited to go and learn about the objects?
2) How might we get infrequent museum visitors to explore the museum and art without getting bored?
3) How might we help infrequent museum visitors explore, learn, and increase interest in art and museums?

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Infrequent museum goers need a way to expand their knowledge and increase their interest in art and museums to help increase institution relevance in communities, art appreciation and reintegration in curriculums, and overall better understanding of the importance of art collection and preservation.

HYPOTHESIS

We believe that by creating a trivia game that utilizes various museum collections’ APIs for infrequent museum goers and student/school groups, we will achieve a deeper engagement with the art, and greater art appreciation, understanding, and reintegration in curriculum.
