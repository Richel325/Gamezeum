# MuseumMindMaze

Museum Mind Maze is a trivia game based on art objects received by using Brooklyn Museum's art collection API. 
Learn more about the art at the museum, and quiz yourself on: 


* The collection the object belongs to
* The materials (medium) the object is made of

Listen to relaxing music as you view different objects from the museum's collections, and explore objects on your phone before seeing them inside the museum on your next visit!
